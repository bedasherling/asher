## 🌟 Why This Boilerplate?

You know how most boilerplates are either way too basic or so overengineered you need a PhD in DevOps to use them?

**This one's different.**  
It’s *enterprise-ready* but *developer-friendly*. Think fast setup, flexible tooling, clean code, and a rock-solid foundation you can build anything on.

Whether you're solo-building something fun or leading a team at scale — this boilerplate gives you:

- ✅ All the essentials already wired together
- 🧪 Testing from the jump
- 💨 Performance perks pre-installed
- ⚙️ A pro-grade DevOps pipeline
- 🎯 The freedom to focus on *your* features

## ✨ What's Inside

Everything you *actually* want in a production-ready starter (and nothing you don’t):

### ⚛️ Next.js 15 — Built for Performance, Made for Scale

Next.js 15 brings the **App Directory** fully into focus — and this boilerplate is built around it. That means:

- **Server Components by default** – Faster apps with less JavaScript shipped to the browser.
- **Routing, layouts, templates, and loading states** – No more `pages/` directory juggling. Define routes like you design them.
- **Streaming with Suspense** – Load content *as it's ready*. Like magic, but real.
- **Parallel + Intercepting Routes** – Complex routing without the hacks.

> 🔮 TL;DR: Next.js 15 doesn’t just make apps faster — it makes *teams* faster.  
> Perfect for projects that need to scale, evolve, and stay maintainable over time.

### 💅 Tailwind CSS v4 — The Utility Framework, Upgraded

Forget wrestling with CSS class names. Tailwind v4 brings:

- ⚡ **Faster build times** thanks to Lightning CSS
- 🎨 **Smarter design tokens** for dark mode, spacing, and theming
- 🛠 **More intuitive utilities** for animations, effects, and layout
- 🧼 **Zero-runtime styling** – it all compiles to lean, clean CSS

With Tailwind, you build your UI *right in your markup* — and this boilerplate is already wired up with best practices, so you can just start styling.

> 🧠 Bonus: Paired with `CVA` (Class Variance Authority), your components stay flexible and consistent across your app.

### 🧱 Radix UI — Accessibility Without the Headache

Radix UI is a set of **unopinionated, accessible components** that let you build complex UIs without reinventing the a11y wheel.

Included in this boilerplate:

- 🧩 **Primitives like Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, Tabs, etc.**
- 🎛 **Composability** – Bring your own styles, layout, and interactions
- ♿ **First-class accessibility** – Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and WAI-ARIA compliance by default

Paired with Tailwind and CVA, Radix helps you build beautiful, interactive interfaces **without sacrificing UX or accessibility**.

> 🦾 It’s like having your own in-house accessibility team — except it ships with your code.
